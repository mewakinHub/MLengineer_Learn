### job market

#### Thai [start to boom?]
> data from jobsdb.com, linkedin.com
- KBTG:  MLE(sr. to tech lead) [but Kasikorn do not like SIIT student haha] (Hybrid)
- Agoda: Lead MLE (no intern) (On-site)
- Aigen: MLE ห้วยขวาง THB 45K-120K/M (consultant company) 
- sertis: MLE(like Datawow, being consultant company) 

#### international job market(abroad) [boom already!]
> data from indeed.com
AVG salary: $116,416/year [much higher than Thai]
- TIKTOK: graduate MLE (Sydney)
- Qualcomm(making chip): Staff MLE (San Diego, CA)(damn sandiego again) $148,500 - $222,500 a year

#### MLE is rare item!
- MLE is rare as person(now, 2023)
- hard to find teacher

#### Master degree
com sci specialize in ML (Georgia tech, USA)

### Note
- Neural Networks are fundamental components of deep learning. They play a pivotal role in enabling deep learning models to learn and represent complex patterns and relationships within data. "Made With ML" underscores the significance of Neural Networks in the context of deep learning.
