### job market

#### Thai [start to boom?]
> data from jobsdb.com, linkedin.com
- KBTG:  MLE(sr. to tech lead) [but Kasikorn do not like SIIT student haha] (Hybrid)
- Agoda: Lead MLE (no intern) (On-site)
- Aigen: MLE ห้วยขวาง THB 45K-120K/M (consultant company) 
- sertis: MLE(like Datawow, being consultant company) 
- AIgen: MLE intern???

#### international job market(abroad) [boom already!]
> data from indeed.com
AVG salary: $116,416/year [much higher than Thai]
- TIKTOK: graduate MLE (Sydney)
- Qualcomm(making chip): Staff MLE (San Diego, CA)(damn sandiego again) $148,500 - $222,500 a year

#### MLE is rare item!
- MLE is rare as person(now, 2023)
- hard to find teacher

#### Study
Master: com sci specialize in ML?
- AI&ML post-grad program(AIM1 for Inter only): https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs/aim1-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning/next
The role of a "Machine Learning Developer" more closely aligns with the tasks and responsibilities typically associated with a "Machine Learning Engineer," as you mentioned. This role involves developing artificial intelligence systems, generating algorithms for making predictions, and working with big data, which are all core responsibilities of a Machine Learning Engineer. Machine Learning Developers are essentially responsible for building and implementing machine learning solutions, which includes the tasks you referred to as MLOps, using tools like MLflow, ML Pipelines, and deployment.

### Note
- Neural Networks are fundamental components of deep learning. They play a pivotal role in enabling deep learning models to learn and represent complex patterns and relationships within data. "Made With ML" underscores the significance of Neural Networks in the context of deep learning.

- CLI - command line interface

(optional)Kebernetes,DS: pytoruch tensorflow
